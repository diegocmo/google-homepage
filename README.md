This is my actuall first project from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
I'll be attempting to recreate the Google Home Page while I also get used to this Git and Github thing
It's far from perfect but I'm happy to have learned all of this so far!
